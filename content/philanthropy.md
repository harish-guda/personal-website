I have donated to the following organizations in the past. Please consider donating to them if their causes appeal to you. Thank you! 

1. [AID India](https://aidindia.org/): You can read about some amazing initiatives of AID (Association for India's Development) to prevent farmer suicide. It is estimated that each day, [about 40 farmers commit suicide in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers%27_suicides_in_India), due to a various reasons, including economic policy, GM crops, drought, debt, etc. Click [here](https://aidindia.org/farmersfund/) to donate to AID India's Farmers Fund.

2. [Sankara Nethralaya](https://www.sankaranethralaya.org/): Sankara Nethralaya is a not-for-profit opthalmic, i.e., eye hospital, that provides care for over 1500 patients a day. As an operations management scholar, reading about [eye surgeries akin to an assembly line](https://aravind.org/case-studies/) was interesting. Click [here](https://www.sankaranethralaya.org/donations.html) to donate to Sankara Nethralaya's various initiatives, incl. sponsoring a catarct surgery. 

3. [Ironman Foundation](https://ironmanfoundation.org/): The Ironman Foundation is a popular charity in the US that organizes many humanitarian relief efforts. My MBA students organize a student-faculty sprint triathlon (5k swim, 12k bike, 0.75k swim), through which I have donated to this organization in the past. I hope they continue this tradition of the sprint triathlon and the fundraiser. 

4. [Valley of the Sun United](https://vsuw.org/): Through my employer ASU, I participate in [ASU's Pledge](https://unitedway.asu.edu/) every year. VSU focuses on multiple issues, incl. housing and homelessness. In the last few years, Arizona has seen the [largest increase in homelessness](https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2023/01/13/arizona-led-nation-for-rise-in-homeless-youth-last-year-hud-report-says/) in the US. Click [here](https://vsuw.org/donate#donate) to donate. 

5. [Tempe Shelter Dog Dash](https://raceroster.com/events/2023/63248/shelter-dog-dash): The city of Tempe organizes a 5k run every April to raise funds for the dog shelters in Maricopa county. While the organization of the run is a hit-or-miss, I support the cause. If you are from Tempe (or from the greater Phoenix region), the run is organized near the Kiwanis Park/Lake, and is a pleasant place to run. I try to get sub-25 minutes each time I run.
