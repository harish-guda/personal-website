## Arizona State University

I teach two courses to the FT-MBA students at ASU, typically in the Fall. 


- SCM 502: Operations and Supply Chain Management (Core: FT-MBA, MS-SCM) [[syllabus](/files/syllabi/syllabus-scm-502.PDF)]


- SCM 551: Operations Planning and Execution (Elective: FT-MBA, Pro-Flex MBA, MS-BA) [[syllabus](/files/syllabi/scm-551-syllabus.PDF)]

  
In the recent past, I have also taught an online undergraduate course (also in the Fall). 

- SCM 300: Global Supply Operations (Core: BS-SCM) [[catalog](https://catalog.apps.asu.edu/catalog/courses/courselist?campusOrOnlineSelection=A&catalogNbr=300&subject=SCM)]
