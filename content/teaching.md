## Arizona State University

I teach two courses to the FT-MBA students at ASU, typically in the Fall. 


- SCM 502: Operations and Supply Chain Management (FT MBA Core) [[syllabus](/files/syllabus-scm-502.PDF)]
<!--  - I plan to maintain an independent [repository](https://harish-guda.github.io/scm-502) of past content -- this is **work-in-progress**. Students may use this at their own discretion. -->

- SCM 551: Operations Planning and Execution (MBA Elective, MS-SCM, MS-GL)[[syllabus](/files/scm-551-syllabus.PDF)]
  - The course is centered around operational decision-making in environments with uncertainty. The course contains a few simulations/experiments. Students are encouraged to build a decision support tool that aids them in decision-making. 
  - The course contains mild use of Python, and is taught via separate tutorials. I use [this](https://aeturrell.github.io/coding-for-economists/intro.html) reference book. 

  
In the recent past, I have also taught an online undergraduate course (also in the Fall). 

- SCM 300: Global Supply Operations.
