## Arizona State University

I teach two courses to the FT-MBA students at ASU, typically in the Fall. 

* SCM 551: Operations Planning and Execution (MBA Elective, MS-SCM)[[syllabus](/files/scm-551-syllabus.PDF)]
  - I run a series of simulation activities:
  		- the Littlefield Technologies simulation at the tactical and operational Levels (appropriately titled the *planning* version and the *execution* version), 
  		- the Supply Chain simulation at the *regional* and the *global* level, 
  		- the classic (4-tier) beer distribution game.
  - The goal of each simulation involves the students to build an R script (or Excel, if students are not enrolled in Analytics) that aids them in decision-making and coordination. 

* SCM 501/502: Operations and Supply Chain Management (MBA Core) [[syllabus](/files/syllabus-scm-502.PDF)]
  - I plan to maintain an independent [repository](https://harish-guda.github.io/scm-502) of past content -- this is **work-in-progress**. Students may use this at their own discretion.

## University of Texas at Dallas

While a PhD student in the Operations Management group at UT Dallas, I was a student instructor during the last few years of my PhD. 

* OPRE 3310: Introduction to Operations Management - BS (BA). [[syllabus](/files/syllabus-opre-3310-fall-2017.PDF)]
  - Nominated for Outstanding Graduate Teacher Award.
