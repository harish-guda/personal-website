## Arizona State University

I teach two courses to the FT-MBA students at ASU, typically in the Fall. 

- SCM 551: Operations Planning and Execution (MBA Elective, MS-SCM)[[syllabus](/files/scm-551-syllabus.PDF)]
  - The course is centered around operational decision-making and analytics[^1] in environments with uncertainty. 
  - The course contains a few simulations/experiments. Students are encouraged to build a decision support tool that aids them in decision-making. 
  - The course contains mild use of Python, and is taught via separate tutorials. 

[^1]: I hate using the term *analytics* (or *data-science*). 


- SCM 501/502: Operations and Supply Chain Management (FT MBA, MiM Core) [[syllabus](/files/syllabus-scm-502.PDF)]
  - I plan to maintain an independent [repository](https://harish-guda.github.io/scm-502) of past content -- this is **work-in-progress**. Students may use this at their own discretion.
