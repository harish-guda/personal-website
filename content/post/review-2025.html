<p>It’s annoying to state the exact same sentence at the start of this post, but yes, it’s been a year since I wrote anything. I am writing this post in February, since I had a lot of deadlines in January, and I couldn’t complete this post.</p>
<p>2025 has, in short, been incredibly challenging. As in every year-in-review, I elaborate on what went well, what didn’t go well, and how 2026 can be better.</p>

<h1>What Went Well in 2025?</h1>
<p>While 2025 wasn’t one of my more productive years, I had some success in making important progress in research and teaching.</p>
<div id="work" class="section level2">
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research</strong>:
<ul>
<li>While I had zero publications this year, I was able to complete the following:
<ul>
<li>Revisions/Re-Submissions of two papers: The paper on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6023254">dynamic pricing</a>, and the paper on <a href="https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/competitive-pricing-manipulation.pdf">pricing under manipulability</a>.</li>
<li>New draft: A new and exciting paper on <a href="https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/shein-experimentation.pdf">new product development with learning spillovers</a>.</li>
<li>Advanced stages of a revision for the paper on <a href="https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/two-stage-effort.pdf">resource-allocation in education</a> that I am hoping to send it out in the next three months.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Teaching</strong>:
<ul>
<li><p>My MBA elective course on Operations Planning (SCM 551) went well. I had a bunch of incredibly smart students this year. One of the highlights of the course was a guest lecture by a Principal AI Scientist from Target on how AI is being used for their Supply Chain Operations and Planning. I also worked on a new case in the Operations-Finance interface, on valuing a firm based on its inventory data. The focal firm that I used is Lululemon, whose products I greatly love and enjoy.</p></li>
<li><p>For my core course on Operations and Supply Chain Management (SCM 502), I wrote a new case this year on flight delays due to the recent government shutdown, using ideas from inventory buildup and queuing theory. I hope my students enjoyed this case that bridges real-world with queueing theory.</p></li>

<li>I ran a ton with the PHX Run Club this year. Running has become such an important part of my life outside of work. This was the year when I hit several PR’s in the shorter distances. I ran so many races this year, with the most notable ones being PHX 10k, Hot Chocolate 15k, and the Rock ‘n’ Roll AZ Half Marathon. I hit all my PR’s this year, with my favorite being the HM PR at 1:40:59. (~7:37 min/mile) Here are some pictures.

<li>I also volunteered at an elite race – The Marathon Project – that took place in Chandler, AZ, and got to meet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McClain">Jessica McClain</a>, who was pacing the 2:37/OTQ women’s marathon.

<h1>What Didn’t Go Well in 2025?</h1>
<div id="work-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: The lack of publications in a calendar year is always frustrating. However, every paper of mine needed substantial work this year.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Travel</strong>: Unfortunately, I couldn’t travel home to see my mom and dad in 2025. I am hoping I can see them soon this year.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: I had to pull out of Mesa Marathon just two weeks before the race due to an extensor tendinitis issue. I am super bummed about it, as I was feeling so good this season.</li>

<h1>How 2026 Can Be Better?</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research</strong>: I am optimistic about two of my papers getting past the final hurdle this year. I am super excited about an ongoing paper with my colleague on information acquisition and sequencing AI-enabled feedback in operational decision-making. More on this coming soon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health and Fitness</strong>: Yoga has been a revelation to me in late 2025! I am falling in love with the practice of yoga. I am hoping to get 500 hours of yoga this year. I also hope to get my 26 miles this year. Fingers crossed.</p></li>
