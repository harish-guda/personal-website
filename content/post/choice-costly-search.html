<h1>Choice Models 101</h1>
<p>Choice models – the theory that studies how individual decision makers (e.g., consumers) make decisions when faced with a collection of alternatives – is of interest to several research disciplines. The canonical choice model is as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A single decision-maker chooses one among a collection <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> alternatives, indexed by <span class="math inline">\(i \in [N]\)</span>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> His (consumption) utility from consuming alternative <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[U_i = v_i + \epsilon_i.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The individual observes both <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>, and selects the alternative that leads to the greatest consumption utility. That is,
<span class="math display">\[i^* = \arg\max_{i \in [N]} U_i.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>The researcher/analyst observes <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span>,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> the eventual choice <span class="math inline">\(i^*\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>. The most common assumption (for analytical tractability) <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> is to assume that the user samples his <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span> as:
<span class="math display">\[\epsilon_i\sim_{i.i.d} Gumbel. \]</span>
This gives the classic MNL model – a probabilistic choice model – where the individual chooses alternative <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with probability:
<span class="math display">\[p_i := \Pr[\text{alternative } i \text{ is chosen}] = \frac{\exp(v_i)}{\sum_{j \in [N]}\exp(v_j)}.\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>If the alternatives are symmetric, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(v_i = v_j\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> pair, then, <span class="math inline">\(p_i = \frac{1}{N}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is what is taught in a typical undergraduate ECON course.</p>

<div id="reality-is-slightly-different" class="section level1">
<h1>Reality is (Slightly) Different</h1>
<p>While a number of applications fit the above assumption (reasonably well), it is virtually impossible for a single decision-maker to know everything about every alternative he evaluates. A central assumption – that the decision-maker knows <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> – feels like a stretch.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about how I evaluate alternatives, especially in situations where I know very little about these alternatives. Two example fit this situation very well in my own life.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a vegetarian living in the US, it is virtually hard for me to find a place that provides a good vegetarian and tasty meal. So, every time I am faced with a task of finding a good lunch/dinner spot, I decide to evaluate each alternative (that my friends suggest) based on the pictures, reviews, menu options, etc., on Yelp/Google Reviews. This is obviously an intensive process. What complicates this more is a need to not visit a previously-visited place.</li>
<li>How I pick movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video: I know very little about a movie I plan to watch, and don’t watch a movie I already watched. So, I read about the movie, IMDB/Rotten Tomato ratings, reviews, etc. Will I perfectly realize the utility I stand to gain from making a particular choice of movie? Highly unlikely.</li>
</ul>

<div id="choices-with-simultaneous-search" class="section level1">
<h1>Choices with <em>Simultaneous</em> Search</h1>
<p>I provide an illustration below (this is my own take on the problem).</p>
<p>Let the true type (utility) of the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> alternative be sampled from:
<span class="math display">\[U_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2).\]</span>
A decision maker has, at his disposal, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> resources (e.g., the budget of time units spent investigating making a decision). He chooses to allot these <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> resources to investigate these <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> alternatives. A unit resource can investigate exactly one alternative. The decision-maker chooses <span class="math display">\[\mathbf{r} = (r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_N) \\ 
\text{ s.t. } \mathbf{r} \ge \boldsymbol{0} \text{ and } \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{1} \le R. \]</span>
Each resource provides a noisy unbiased signal of the alternative it investigates. That is,
<span class="math display">\[s_r \sim \mathcal{N}(U_{i_r}, \sigma_R^2).\]</span>
The decision-maker’s posterior about alternative <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is:
<span class="math display">\[U_i | r_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\alpha (r_i) \overline{s}_i + (1-\alpha(r_i)) \mu, \left(\sigma^2 + \frac{\sigma_R^2}{r_i}\right) \alpha_i (1-\alpha_i)\right) \\
\text{ where } \alpha(r_i) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sigma^2 + \frac{\sigma_R^2}{r_i}}  \quad
\text{ and } \overline{s}_i = \frac{\sum_{r: i_r =i} s_r}{r_i}\]</span></p>
<p>For convenience, refer to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(r_i)\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i\)</span>. The principal chooses the alternative with the highest posterior mean, i.e.,
<span class="math display">\[i^* = \arg\max_{i \in [N]} \mathbb{E}[U_i | r_i]. \]</span>
The principal’s objective simplifies to:
<span class="math display">\[\mu + \sigma \max_{\mathbf{r} \ge \boldsymbol{0}} \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{s|r}} [\max_i \gamma_i z_i] \\
\text{ where } \quad  \gamma_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{\sigma_R^2}{{\sigma^2} r_i}}} \quad \text{ and } z_i \sim_{i.i.d} \mathcal{N}(0, 1).\]</span>
Normalize <span class="math inline">\(\mu = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = 1\)</span>. It suffices to solve:
<span class="math display">\[
\max_{\mathbf{r} } \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{s | r}} [\max_i \gamma_i z_i] \\
\text{ where } \gamma_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{\sigma_R^2}{r_i}}}
\]</span>
Solving this problem analytically can be done for some special cases (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(N = 2\)</span>, or the comparison of some heuristics, e.g., the fully symmetric vs. fully asymmetric solution). I provide a numerical comparison below.</p>
