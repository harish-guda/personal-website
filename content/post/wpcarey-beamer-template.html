<h1>A Simple Beamer Template</h1>
<p>I created a simple Beamer template based on a research presentation I gave at a recent conference. I realized there was nothing specific to my department/school available out in the internet, so I had to create one from scratch.</p>
<p>Here are the sample slides: <a href="https://github.com/harish-guda/wpcarey-beamer-template/raw/master/wpcarey-beamer-template.pdf">PDF</a></p>
<p>Please feel free to fork this from my <a href="https://github.com/harish-guda/wpcarey-beamer-template">Github repo</a>.</p>
<p>Some features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prominently features (slightly modified) ASU colors: <span style="color: maroon;">maroon</span> and <span style="color: gold;">gold</span></li>
<li>Based on the <code>madrid</code> beamer theme: thus, it enables all block styles.</li>
<li>A ticker at the bottom for slide progress.</li>
<li>Three commands: <code>newterm</code>, <code>callout</code> and <code>bigquestion</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few options are commented out (e.g., the <em>Lato</em> font, <code>transitionframe</code>, etc.). If you have an improved version, please email me: I will be happy to include/replace my style file.</p>
