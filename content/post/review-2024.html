<p>I realize that it has been a year since I wrote anything on my blog. Perhaps, that’s an indication of how busy/stressful the last year has been for me. I will plan on writing more often this year.</p>
<p>As I did <a href="https://harishguda.me/post/2024/01/12/2023-the-year-in-review/">last year</a>, I will break my review into three parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What went well in 2024?</li>
<li>What didn’t go well in 2024?</li>
<li>What did I learn, and how can 2025 be better?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research</strong>: I had slight success in getting a few positive signals on some of my papers. I received two requests for revisions (at two premier journals of my field, MSOM and MS). While a third paper was rejected, my coauthors and I decided to implement all the recommended changes, and resubmit this work back to a premier journal. These three papers have kept me busy this year. I enjoyed working on all these papers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/two-stage-effort.pdf">paper on non-profit organizations</a> was an interesting paper, both in the context its rooted in, and in the results we demonstrate. We show why scarcity of resources in severely resource constrained environments – like NPO’s in developing countries – may be a blessing! A new version of this paper will be out soon.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/competitive-pricing-manipulation.pdf">paper on competitive pricing under manipulability</a> was interesting because it gave me an opportunity to understand choice models — a class of workhorse models used to model consumer choice — better. Besides, the paper is rooted in the context of manipulation due to the recent emergence of Gen AI, and presents interesting results on anti-competitive outcomes due to manipulation. Much has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/youre-probably-falling-for-fake-product-reviews-b4d07f23">said</a> about the ongoing fake reviews problem in e-commerce. However, I do not see this problem ending anytime soon, so we may have to better understand the outcomes in its presence.</p></li>
<li><p>A third paper on competitive AI-based pricing (not publicly available) was quite enjoyable to work on (details intentionally omitted).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I was awarded <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/faculty-research/awards#research">WP Carey’s Early Career Research Award</a> (along with my colleague Heng). This has been a big boost to my confidence that my research agenda and work is appreciated within my department and the school.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching</strong>: I was recognized in the <a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2024/09/28/favorite-mba-professors/">Poets and Quants’ Favorite MBA Professors</a> — I am so grateful to my student Bailey for the nomination. I was also nominated within WP Carey for a teaching award called <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2024-05/2023-2024%20Dean%27s%20List%20for%20Teaching%20Impact_0.pdf">“Business is Personal” Award</a>.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Family and Travel</strong>: I was able to travel thrice to visit my parents this year and spend about 2-3 weeks each time – something I’ll forever be grateful for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health and Fitness</strong>: I ran a ton with the <a href="https://phxrunclub.com/">Phoenix Run Club</a>, and a little bit with <a href="https://www.solesportsrunning.com/content/group-runs">Sole Sports Group Run</a>. Overall, I am pleased to see my body reacting well to higher mileages (~25 miles/week) this winter. I have enjoyed running, and I hope to continue with these runs in 2025 as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>My favorite race this year has been the Phoenix Hot Chocolate 15k – where I got a time of 1:26 (~9:20 min/mile).</li>

<h1>What Didn’t Go Well in 2024?</h1>
<div id="work-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Research</strong>: Zero published work this year. Whenever I have a year with no publications, it worries me. A frequent piece of advice I get from my senior colleagues is to “smoothen” my output to avoid such long inter-publication delays. This is something I have to actively work on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching</strong>: Teaching has been challenging this year due to multiple reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>My advanced elective on demand planning had an explosion in enrollment (usually a class of 25, but had close to 50 this year), leading to a lack of interpersonal engagement, and often having to cycle through the motions. Personally, I do not enjoy teaching large classes. This “assembly-line”-ization of higher education is something I am not a fan of.</li>
<li>I had to travel to ASU’s West Campus (close to the new TSMC factory), with a commute of about 2 hours every session. The West campus strategic location to the rising tech/semiconductor hub in the Phoenix metro is an exciting prospect. However, the commute took a significant toll on me during Fall.</li>
<li>Changes to the FT-MBA program meant I had fewer lecture sessions, and it was a challenge covering the material with fewer sessions.</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Losing my PhD Advisor</strong>: Earlier this year, <a href="https://chairs.utdallas.edu/biographies/dr-milind-dawande/">Dr. Milind Dawande</a> (my PhD advisor) had passed away. This has been a big shock to me. Half of my “weekly conversational time” used to be with Milind. Not having him around has left a huge void.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Health and Fitness</strong>: The early part of 2024 has been injury-filled, with getting an IT Band injury in February and in June. These injuries have kept me out of running for several months. Traveling to India also meant I had to take breaks in my running schedule, and I may have to miss the Rock ’n Roll (AZ) Half Marathon this year – something I am super bummed about. Also, getting diagnosed with influenza twice within a span of 2 months has been painful.</p></li>

<li><strong>Research</strong>: I am optimistic about the ongoing projects reaching fruition soon. My main targets for this year is to take each of my ongoing research papers to completion in the best way possible.</li>

<li><p><strong>Health and Fitness</strong>: I am actively strength training in a gym, along with Strength 50 classes at Orangetheory, in addition to better planning my mileage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Family and Travel</strong>: I will have to renew my work visa this year. I am worried if I may not have an opportunity to travel this year. Fingers crossed.</p></li>
