It's annoying to state the exact same sentence at the start of this post, but yes, it's been a year since I wrote anything. I am writing this post in February, since I had a lot of deadlines in January, and I couldn't complete this post. 

2025 has, in short, been incredibly challenging. As in every year-in-review, I elaborate on what went well, what didn't go well, and how 2026 can be better. 

# What Went Well in 2025?

While 2025 wasn't one of my more productive years, I had some success in making important progress in research and teaching.  

## Work

- **Research**: 
  - While I had zero publications this year, I was able to complete the following: 
    - Revisions/Re-Submissions of two papers: The paper on [dynamic pricing](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6023254), and the paper on [pricing under manipulability](https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/competitive-pricing-manipulation.pdf). 
    - New draft: A new and exciting paper on [new product development with learning spillovers](https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/shein-experimentation.pdf). 
    - Advanced stages of a revision for the paper on [resource-allocation in education](https://harishguda.me/files/manuscripts/two-stage-effort.pdf) that I am hoping to send it out in the next three months.

- **Teaching**: 
  - My MBA elective course on Operations Planning (SCM 551) went well. I had a bunch of incredibly smart students this year. One of the highlights of the course was a guest lecture by a Principal AI Scientist from Target on how AI is being used for their Supply Chain Operations and Planning. I also worked on a new case in the Operations-Finance interface, on valuing a firm based on its inventory data. The focal firm that I used is Lululemon, whose products I greatly love and enjoy. 
  
  - For my core course on Operations and Supply Chain Management (SCM 502), I wrote a new case this year on flight delays due to the recent government shutdown, using ideas from inventory buildup and queuing theory. I hope my students enjoyed this case that bridges real-world with queueing theory. 

## Personal
- **Health and Fitness**: 
  - I ran a ton with the PHX Run Club this year. Running has become such an important part of my life outside of work. This was the year when I hit several PR's in the shorter distances. I ran so many races this year, with the most notable ones being PHX 10k, Hot Chocolate 15k, and the Rock 'n' Roll AZ Half Marathon. I hit all my PR's this year, with my favorite being the HM PR at 1:40:59. (~7:37 min/mile) Here are some pictures.

  - I also volunteered at an elite race -- The Marathon Project -- that took place in Chandler, AZ, and got to meet [Jessica McClain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_McClain), who was pacing the 2:37/OTQ women's marathon.

# What Didn't Go Well in 2025?

## Work

  - **Research**: The lack of publications in a calendar year is always frustrating. However, every paper of mine needed substantial work this year. 

## Personal
  - **Travel**: Unfortunately, I couldn't travel home to see my mom and dad in 2025. I am hoping I can see them soon this year. 
  - **Health**: I had to pull out of Mesa Marathon just two weeks before the race due to an extensor tendinitis issue. I am super bummed about it, as I was feeling so good this season. 
  
# How 2026 Can Be Better?

- **Research**: I am optimistic about two of my papers getting past the final hurdle this year. I am super excited about an ongoing paper with my colleague on information acquisition and sequencing AI-enabled feedback in operational decision-making. More on this coming soon. 

- **Health and Fitness**: Yoga has been a revelation to me in late 2025! I am falling in love with the practice of yoga. I am hoping to get 500 hours of yoga this year. I also hope to get my 26 miles this year. Fingers crossed.
