<p>One of my favorite results in optimization is the max-min inequality. This is taught in just about every introductory course in optimization, math. for econ, and/or allied courses. The result is as follows.</p>
<div id="the-result" class="section level1">
<h1>The Result</h1>
<p>Consider a bivariate function <span class="math inline">\(f(z, w)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((z, w) \in Z \times W\)</span>. Then,
<span class="math display">\[
\sup_{z \in Z} \inf_{w \in W} f(z, w) \le \inf_{w \in W}\sup_{z \in Z}f(z, w).
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="an-interpretation" class="section level1">
<h1>An Interpretation</h1>
<p>While it’s easy to algebraically think/vizualize this result in a 3D space, one intuitive way to think of this result is a game with an adversary (a zero-sum game). Suppose your (resp., adversary’s) action set is <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> (resp., <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>). Your payoff from an action <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> and adversary’s action <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(f(z,w)\)</span>, while the adversary’s payoff is <span class="math inline">\(-f(z, w)\)</span>. The result states that your <em>best worst-case payoff</em> is inferior to the <em>worst best-case payoff</em>. Stated differently, you are better off moving second than moving first in a game with an adversary. I find it intuitive to remember this result as <strong>the second-mover</strong> result.</p>
<p>Edit: I was informed recently that this interpretation is also present in the textbook <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">Convex Optimization</a> by Boyd and Vandenberghe (see Chapter 5.4.3).</p>
</div>
<div id="where-this-can-show-up" class="section level1">
<h1>Where This (Can) Show Up</h1>
<p>This result has a lot of applications, but one place I’ve seen this result often is in robust optimization, which is essentially a game with an adversary. This result provides a simple bound on the worst payoff a decision-maker can get if they were to play an adversary.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-simple-proof" class="section level1">
<h1>A (Simple) Proof</h1>
<p>I’ve seen at least three different proof ideas for this result. My favorite one is the proof by contradiction. I share that below.</p>
<p>Suppose the result does not hold. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\exists z_0\)</span> s.t.
<span class="math display">\[
\inf_{w \in W} f(z_0, w) &gt; \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z,w).
\]</span>
In words, the above inequality states that there exists an action <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span> that guarantees you a strictly higher payoff than what would happen if you move second.</p>
<p>But this is equivalent to
<span class="math display">\[
\inf_{w \in W}\sup_{z \in \{z_0\}}f(z, w) &gt; \inf_{w \in W} \sup_{z \in Z} f(z,w)
\]</span>
That is, you do strictly better if your action set is the singleton set <span class="math inline">\(\{z_0\}\)</span> than a superset of <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>. But this is impossible, since your action set is a superset of <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>, so you must do at least as well. This completes the proof.</p>
