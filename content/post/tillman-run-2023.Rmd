One of my favorite runs in Tempe is the [Pat Tillman Run](https://pattillmanfoundation.org/pats-run/), organized by the Pat Tillman Foundation.

The organization this year was great. I was surprised to see more than 28,000 participants in the event this year. Bib #'s and start times depend on self-reported average time per mile. I think I gave something around 10 minutes/mile, so I was part of bib #'s 18,000-19,000. While the event was supposed to start at 7am, given the crowd, they started the race in phases. I was in the 18th batch, and my run started at around 7:45am. 

I was super under-prepared for this run. I didn't have a flipcase for my phone and keys, and I biked to the start zone (ASU football stadium). In hindsight, I am surprised I did as well as I did. I had a terrible day the previous day (struggled to prove some conjecture), and I went to bed quite late thinking about it.

## Run

It was warm by the time I started -- AZ heat really sets in early. Thanks to the volunteers at every mile, I was well hydrated during the run. 

## Finish

Perhaps, my favorite part of a run is the finish. I could get a surge towards the end and managed to cut my target 45 minutes by a couple of minutes. The race ends at the 42nd yard of the ASU football stadium (42 for Tillman). 

Here's the [final timings](https://www.athlinks.com/event/34467/results/Event/1044977/Course/2345031/Bib/18308) based on the chip in my bib. I think I was at the 64th percentile among male runners (3305/9228). Something to improve in my future runs.
