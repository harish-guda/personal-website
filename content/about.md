Hi. 

I am Harish Guda. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Supply Chain Management at the [W.P. Carey School of Business](https://wpcarey.asu.edu) at Arizona State University. 

My research interests are at the interface of technology, service operations management and marketplace design (in particular, the platform economy). 

I enjoy theory.
