Hi. 

I am Harish Guda. I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Supply Chain Management at the [W.P. Carey School of Business](https://wpcarey.asu.edu) at Arizona State University. 

My research interests are at the interface of technology, marketplace design and operations management. I am also interested in the economics of supply chains. 

I enjoy theory.
