# A Simple Beamer Template

I created a simple Beamer template based on a research presentation I gave at a recent conference. I realized there was nothing specific to my department/school available out in the internet, so I had to create one from scratch. 

Here are the sample slides: [PDF](https://github.com/harish-guda/wpcarey-beamer-template/raw/master/wpcarey-beamer-template.pdf)

Please feel free to fork this from my [Github repo](https://github.com/harish-guda/wpcarey-beamer-template). 

Some features: 

- Prominently features (slightly modified) ASU colors: <span style="color: maroon;">maroon</span> and <span style="color: gold;">gold</span> 
- Based on the `madrid` beamer theme: thus, it enables all block styles. 
- A ticker at the bottom for slide progress. 
- Three commands: `newterm`, `callout` and `bigquestion`. 

A few options are commented out (e.g., the *Lato* font, `transitionframe`, etc.).  If you have an improved version, please email me: I will be happy to include/replace my style file.
